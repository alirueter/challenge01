# challenge01

## Overview
Challenge 1 consists of refactoring code to meet accessibility standards. The source code should contain semantic HTML elements, logical HTML structure, alt attributes associated with images, sequential headings, and a descriptive website title. The links should all work and the CSS should be consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure. The CSS file should also be properly commented. The application should be deployed to a live url and load without errors. 

## Screenshot
The application should look like the following image.
